# Project-14---Face-Mesh-Detector
**Abstract**

This project implements a real-time facial landmark detection system using MediaPipe's Face Mesh solution integrated with OpenCV. The system captures live video feed from a webcam and identifies up to 468 facial landmarks per detected face, enabling dense face geometry estimation. Utilizing the `FACEMESH_TESSELATION` connections, the model outlines the facial structure with a mesh overlay, which includes features like eyes, nose, lips, and jawline. The solution supports detection of multiple faces simultaneously and provides real-time feedback with frames-per-second (FPS) computation for performance monitoring. This setup is lightweight and runs efficiently on standard consumer-grade hardware, making it suitable for various applications including facial analysis, virtual makeup, AR filters, and emotion recognition. The modular design ensures easy integration into more advanced computer vision pipelines or interactive user interfaces.
